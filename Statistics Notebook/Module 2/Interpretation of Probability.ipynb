It requires that it is possible to repeat this chance experiment many times.\n\nWhile interned during the Second World War, John Kerrich tossed a coin on 10,000 times and observed 5,067 tosses resulting in heads.\n\nThe long-run interpretation of probability can make it difficult to interpret it for single event:\n    'What I was wrong about this year' by David Leonhardt(12/24/2017)\n\nSometimes people use a different interpretation:\n    \"The probability that my best friend calls today is 30%,\" \n    then this statement clearly cannot be interpreted as a long-run frequency because today, the particular circumstances of today happened only once. So, what this person means is there's simply a subjective feeling of 30% that this event will happen. So, this is called a subjective probability. It's not based on experiments, and different people may assign different probabilities to the same event.",
