Computing probabilities comes down to applying a few basic rules repeatedly:\n\n    We saw that P(newborn is a girl) = 48.8%\n    Therefore   P(newborn is a boy ) = 51.2%\n\n    More formally, write A for an event, such as A = 'newborn is a girl'.\n    Complement rule: P(A does not occur) = 1 - P(A)\n\n    Now let's look at a different chance expriment: Rolling a die\n\n    Since each of its six faces is equally likely to come up, each has probability 1/6.\n\n    Rule for equally likely outcomes: If there are n possible outcomes and they are equally like, then the probability of an event A is the P(A) =  [(number of outcomes in A) / n ]",
